# SpringBootProject


Micro Services:

Single code base with mulitple modules -> only one WAR/Jar file

Single application as small services (Stateless - new request) - We will have multiple WAR files.


IAAS  - infrastucture
PAAS  - application
SAAS  - Software

RestController


/resources or endpoint.

getmapping
postmapping
deletemapping
putmapping
patchmapping -> not relavent

@requestparam
@pathvariable ( which expose to outer world becuase it expect in the url)
spring rest / jerrsey/ jackson

/swagger-ui.html#


@SpringBootApplication: Entry Point
@EnableAutoConfiguration: Automatically configures dependencies
@ComponentScan: scans all the beans and package declarations when the application initializes



spring-boot-starter-actuator -> monitor and manage
spring-boot-starter-security -> Spring Security
spring-boot-starter-web
spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf
spring-boot-starter-test -> to write test cases


If you added @SpringBootApplication annotation to the class, you do not need to add the @EnableAutoConfiguration, @ComponentScan and @SpringBootConfiguration annotation.
The @SpringBootApplication annotation includes all other annotations.

To write Rest Endpoint:  @RestController add at the class level and @RequestMapping add at the method level.


mvn clean install
goto target folder
java â€“jar


Remember that when you upgrade the Spring Boot version, dependencies also will upgrade automatically.
